  <h1>Game Design</h1>
  <p>
    Game design is the process of crafting the rules, mechanics, objectives, and narrative that define 
    a player's experience. It blends creativity with technical knowledge to build games that are 
    engaging, challenging, and fun. A good game designer must consider player motivation, pacing, balance, 
    and accessibility. Whether developing a story-driven RPG or a competitive multiplayer shooter, 
    game design lays the foundation for how a game feels and plays. Itâ€™s a field that combines storytelling, 
    psychology, and user interaction.
