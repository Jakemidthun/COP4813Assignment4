  <h1>Game Development Tech</h1>
  <p>
    Game development technology refers to the tools and software used to create video games. 
    This includes game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine, which provide frameworks for graphics, 
    physics, sound, and scripting. Developers also use 3D modeling tools, animation software, and 
    code editors to build immersive environments and interactive gameplay. As hardware capabilities 
    expand, game development tech continues to evolve, enabling more realistic graphics, smarter AI, 
    and broader cross-platform compatibility.
