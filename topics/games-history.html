  <h1>History of Video Games</h1>
  <p>
    The history of video games spans over five decades, beginning with simple arcade games 
    like Pong and evolving into complex, cinematic experiences such as The Last of Us and 
    Red Dead Redemption. In the 1970s and 80s, companies like Atari and Nintendo helped define 
    early gaming culture. The 1990s saw the rise of 3D graphics and iconic franchises like 
    Pok√©mon and Final Fantasy. Today, games are a global phenomenon, reflecting cultural trends, 
    advancing technology, and offering new forms of interactive storytelling.
