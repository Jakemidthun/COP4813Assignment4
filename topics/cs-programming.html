  <h1>Programming</h1>
  <p>
  Programming is the process of creating instructions that a computer can execute to perform specific operations.
  It involves writing code using languages like Python, Java, or C++ to solve problems, automate tasks, and build 
  applications. From simple calculators to complex AI algorithms, programming is the essential skill that underlies 
  nearly every modern technology.
