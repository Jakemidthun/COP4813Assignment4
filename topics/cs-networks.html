  <h1>Networks</h1>
  <p>
    A computer network is a system that allows computers and devices to communicate and share resources.
    Networks range from small local area networks (LANs) in homes and offices to massive global networks 
    like the internet. They enable the transmission of data such as emails, video streams, and files 
    between users. Understanding how networks function involves concepts like IP addresses, routers, 
    and communication protocols. Networking is foundational to todayâ€™s connected world.
