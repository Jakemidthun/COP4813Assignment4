  <h1>Sustainable Design</h1>
  <p>
    Sustainable architecture focuses on creating buildings that minimize environmental impact while maximizing 
    energy efficiency and human well-being. It incorporates practices such as using renewable energy sources, 
    passive heating and cooling, water conservation, and sustainable materials. Architects who design with 
    sustainability in mind strive to reduce a buildingâ€™s carbon footprint and ensure long-term resilience. 
    As climate change becomes a growing concern, sustainable design plays a crucial role in the future of construction.
